# Project Information

## Project Description:

The aim of this project is to implement a billing system for a company. The company has a list of customers and their orders. The company has to generate a bill for each customer. The bill should contain the name of the customer, the total cost of the order, the total cost of shipping, the total cost of tax, the total cost of the order after tax and shipping.

## Project Structure:

The project is divided into the following java files:

Billing.java - This is the class which contains the main method. - This is the entry point to the program and links to the other classes.
Customer.java - This is the class which contains the Customer class.

Category.java - This is the class which contains the Category class.

Order.java - This is the class which contains the Order class.

Db.java - This is the class which contains the Database of the application.

README.md - This is the file which contains the instructions to run the program.

# Design Patterns Used:

In this project, the database is created only once.

Injectable Design Pattern - This is used to inject the database into the other classes.
In this project, the database is injected into the other classes.

Composite Design Pattern - This is used to create a tree structure of the database.
